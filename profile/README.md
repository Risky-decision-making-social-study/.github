## Abstract

We wanted to conducted an experiment to compare the risk preferences of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in two different conditions: social and nonsocial. We evaluated their preference for a safe or a risky option after repeated information sampling. To conduct this experiment, we designed a food dispenser that could either run automatically or involve a human distributor and needed to distribute different amounts or qualities of food reward.

## Dependencies

### Hardware

The provided CAD drawings where created in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/), which has a sufficient free version for personal use, a full version can also be obtained free of charge for education and research purposes.
Alternatively the repository also includes exports of the drawings as STEP- and STL-Files for you to import in you preferred CAD software or 3D-Printing directly.

Additionally, the apparatus features specially developed header module for Raspberry Pi. It was created using [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/), a free an Open Source printed circuit board design software.

### Firmware

The Firmware was developed using Python.
