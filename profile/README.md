## Abstract

We compared the risk preferences of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in a social and a
nonsocial condition, where we assessed their preference for a safe or a risky option after repeated
information sampling. To this end, we devised a food dispenser that could run automatically or involve
a human distributor. Only two of the initial set of ten monkeys reached the final test conditions; these
two monkeys did not prefer a particular option in any of the conditions. In light of the unexpected
difficulties that the monkeys had in learning the reward contingencies, we discuss a potential problem
with paradigms that involve extracting statistical information from repeated sampling events. Given
that such a paradigm has been used repeatedly and is still being used with different animals, we feel
the field might benefit from a critical discussion of how to increase the validity of the data generated
by this paradigm. We suggest that it is crucial to obtain a good estimate of the amount of sampling
information a particular study population needs for optimal decision-making before any test
conditions are run. We would have benefited greatly from the availability of more detailed reporting
of similar difficulties in other populations, for example, information regarding timeframe and
necessary amount of information on sampling events or previous failures with specific presentation
formats. We hope this report can serve as a source of information for others working on this or related
topics.
